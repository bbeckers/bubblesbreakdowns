	\paragraph{Syntax}
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 &Variable_Name
 $Variable_Name
 \end{verbatim}
 
 \paragraph{Description}
 
 Use either a \texttt{\&} or \texttt{\$} sign in front of a variable name
 to create a reference to that variable's steady-state level in
 transition or measurement equations. The two signs, \texttt{\&} and
 \texttt{\$}, are interchangeable.
 
 The steady-state reference will be replaced
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
   with the variable itself at the time model's steady state is being
   calculated, i.e.~when calling the function
   \href{model/sstate}{\texttt{sstate}};
 \item
   with the actually assigned steady-state value at the time the model is
   being solved, i.e.~when calling the function
   \href{model/solve}{`solve'}'.
 \end{itemize}
 
 \paragraph{Example}
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 x = rho*x{-1} + (1-rho)*&x + epsilon_x !! x = 1;
 \end{verbatim}
