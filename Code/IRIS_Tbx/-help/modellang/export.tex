 \paragraph{Description}
 
 You can include in the model file the contents of files you need or want
 to carry around together with the model; a typical example is your own
 m-file functions used in the model equations.
 
 The file or files are created and save under the name specified in the
 \texttt{!export} keyword at the time you load the model using the
 function \href{model/model}{\texttt{model}}. The contents of the export
 files is are also stored in the model objects. You can manually
 re-create and re-save the files by running the function
 \href{model/export}{\texttt{export}}.
 
 Note that if no filename is provided or \texttt{FILENAME} is empty, the
 corresponding \texttt{!export} block is discarded without an error or
 warning.
