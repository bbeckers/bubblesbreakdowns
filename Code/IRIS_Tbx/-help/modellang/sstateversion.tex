	\paragraph{Syntax}
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 Equation !! Steady_state_equation;
 \end{verbatim}
 
 \paragraph{Description}
 
 For each transition or measurement equation, you can provide a separate
 steady-state version of it. The steady-state version is used when you
 run the \href{model/sstate}{\texttt{sstate}} function. This is useful
 when you can substantially simplify some parts of the dynamic equations,
 and help therefore the numerical solver to achieve faster and more
 accurate results.
 
 Why is a double exclamation point, \texttt{!!}, used to start the
 steady-state versions of equations? Because if you associate your model
 file extension with the Matlab editor, anything after an exclamation
 point is displayed red making it easier to spot the steady-state
 equations.
 
 \paragraph{Example 1}
 
 The following steady state version will be, of course, valid only in
 stationary models where we can safely remove lags and leads.
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 Lambda = Lambda{1}*(1+r)*beta !! r = 1/beta - 1;
 \end{verbatim}
 
 \paragraph{Example 2}
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 log(A) = log(A{-1}) + epsilon_a !! A = 1;
 \end{verbatim}
