	\paragraph{Syntax}
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 [X,Incl,Range] = db2array(D)
 [X,Incl,Range] = db2array(D,List)
 [X,Incl,Range] = db2array(D,List,Range)
 \end{verbatim}
 
 \paragraph{Input arguments}
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
   \texttt{D} {[} struct {]} - Input database with tseries objects that
   will be converted to a numeric array.
 \item
   \texttt{List} {[} char \textbar{} cellstr {]} - List of tseries names
   that will be converted to a numeric array; if not specified, all
   tseries entries found in the input database, \texttt{D}, will be
   included in the output arrays, \texttt{X}.
 \item
   \texttt{Range} {[} numeric \textbar{} \texttt{Inf} {]} - Date range;
   \texttt{Inf} means a range from the very first non-NaN observation to
   the very last non-NaN observation.
 \end{itemize}
 
 \paragraph{Output arguments}
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
   \texttt{X} {[} numeric {]} - Numeric array with observations from
   individual tseries objects in columns.
 \item
   \texttt{Incl} {[} cellstr {]} - List of tseries names that have been
   actually found in the database.
 \item
   \texttt{Range} {[} numeric {]} - Date range actually used; this output
   argument is useful when the input argument \texttt{Range} is missing
   or \texttt{Inf}.
 \end{itemize}
 
 \paragraph{Description}
 
 The output array, \texttt{X}, is always NPer-by-NList-by-NAlt, where
 NPer is the length of the \texttt{Range} (the number of periods), NList
 is the number of tseries included in the \texttt{List}, and NAlt is the
 maximum number of columns that any of the tseries included in the
 \texttt{List} have.
 
 All tseries with more than one dimension (i.e.~with more than one
 column) are always expanded along 3rd dimension only. For instance, a
 10-by-2-by-3 tseries will occupy a 10-by-1-by-6 space in \texttt{X} at
 its respective location.
