	System priors are priors imposed on the system properties of the model
 as whole, such as shock response functions, frequency response
 functions, correlations, or spectral densities; moreover, systempriors
 objects also allow for priors on combinations of parameters. The system
 priors can be combined with priors on individual parameters.
 
 Systempriors methods:
 
 \paragraph{Constructor}
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
   \href{systempriors/systempriors}{\texttt{systempriors}} - Create new
   system priors.
 \end{itemize}
 
 \paragraph{Setting up priors}
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
   \href{systempriors/prior}{\texttt{prior}} - Create prior for a system
   property.
 \end{itemize}
 
 \paragraph{Getting information about system priors}
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
   \href{systempriors/detail}{\texttt{detail}} - Display details of
   system priors.
 \item
   \href{systempriors/isempty}{\texttt{isempty}} - True if the system
   priors object is empty.
 \item
   \href{systempriors/length}{\texttt{length}} - Number or priors imposed
   in system priors object.
 \end{itemize}
